**EduTrack Student Performance Analysis** 📊  
🚀 **Project Description**

The EduTrack Student Performance Analysis project explores and uncovers factors affecting student academic performance across multiple subjects. Using statistical analysis and visualizations, the project highlights trends related to gender, parental education, socioeconomic status, and test preparation, providing actionable insights for targeted interventions and improved learning outcomes.

🎯 **Key Objectives**

Analyze student performance across subjects: Math, Reading, and Writing

Understand the impact of gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation courses on scores

Identify patterns and disparities to suggest equity-focused academic interventions

📂 **Dataset**

Source: Kaggle – Students Performance in Exams

Features include: Gender, Parental Education Level, Lunch Type, Test Preparation, Math Score, Reading Score, Writing Score

🛠 **Tools & Technologies**

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Techniques: Statistical summaries, correlation analysis, bar plots, boxplots, trend analysis

Visualization: Distribution plots, comparative charts, performance trends

📌 **Key Insights**
1️⃣ Gender-Based Performance Trends

Female students outperform males in reading and writing

Male students slightly outperform in math

Low-performing outliers are more frequent among males → indicates need for targeted support

2️⃣ Parental Education Correlation

Higher parental education (Master’s, Bachelor’s) → higher student performance

Lower parental education (High school, Associate’s) → lower student performance

3️⃣ Subject-Level Averages & Variability

Reading: highest average (69.17) & lowest variability → consistent performance

Math: lowest average (66.09) & highest variability → need for targeted interventions

Writing: moderate average, high variability → support struggling students

4️⃣ Lunch Type Effect

Standard lunch students perform better than free/reduced lunch students

Highlights socioeconomic disparities in performance

5️⃣ Test Preparation Courses

Completion of prep courses improves performance, especially in writing

Supports value of institution-sponsored prep programs

6️⃣ Equity & Disparities

Top performers: Female students from higher-income, higher-educated families with prep courses

Lowest performers: Male students from lower-income households with low parental education and no prep course

Suggests multi-tiered interventions and equity-focused programs

📈 **Project Outcomes**

Provides data-driven recommendations for subject-specific interventions

Highlights demographic disparities to guide policy and academic strategies

Helps educators and institutions improve student learning outcomes
